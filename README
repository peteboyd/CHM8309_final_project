Comments: This code was written in partial fulfillment of the course CHM8309 
    "Advanced Scientific Programming for Chemists".

Python program designed for molecular dynamics simulation of atoms in a box.

== Description ==

The code features several commonplace MD simulation tools such as the 
velocity verlet and leap frog integrators, and long-range dispersion 
interaction potentials.

It currenlty does not support an input file, but one can be included with
ease due to the modular nature of constructing atom types and including
them within the molecular dynamics simulation.  As such the simulation will
run on a pair of noble gas atoms, Xe and Kr interacting in a 20 x 20 x 20
Angstrom box.
